# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.

# The following line activates a set of recommended lints for Flutter apps,
# packages, and plugins designed to encourage good coding practices.
include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml

linter:
  # The lint rules applied to this project can be customized in the
  # section below to disable rules from the `package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml`
  # included above or to enable additional rules. A list of all available lints
  # and their documentation is published at
  # https://dart-lang.github.io/linter/lints/index.html.
  #
  # Instead of disabling a lint rule for the entire project in the
  # section below, it can also be suppressed for a single line of code
  # or a specific dart file by using the `// ignore: name_of_lint` and
  # `// ignore_for_file: name_of_lint` syntax on the line or in the file
  # producing the lint.
  rules:
     avoid_print: true  # Uncomment to disable the `avoid_print` rule
     prefer_single_quotes: true  # Uncomment to enable the `prefer_single_quotes` rule
     avoid_empty_else: true # Avoid empty else statements.
     avoid_returning_null_for_future: true # Avoid returning null for Future.
     unnecessary_statements: true # Avoid using unnecessary statements.
     always_declare_return_types: true # Declare method return types.
     always_put_required_named_parameters_first: true # Put required named parameters first.
     always_require_non_null_named_parameters: true # Specify @required on named parameters without defaults.
     annotate_overrides: true # Annotate overridden members.
     avoid_returning_null_for_void: true # Avoid returning null for void.
     camel_case_types: true # Name types using UpperCamelCase.
     constant_identifier_names: true # Prefer using lowerCamelCase for constant names.
     empty_catches: true # Avoid empty catch blocks.
